|**Languages:** JavaScript, HTML, CSS <br>**Back End:** Node.js <br>**Database:** MongoDB <br>**Targeted Platform:** Browser |Create a web application that can dynamically handle user requests and perform complex tasks, reacting to unique user inputs.|Client wishes for a web app that functions well and looks nice, and is not particularly familiar with the technical details. node.js uses asynchronous requests so is fast, which is important as we will include videos.|**Ethan:**<br>For my A-level computer science project, I created a web app using node.js and mongodb, however at a smaller scale. It also run locally, so only devices on the same network could access it. As such, more research will be required for this tech stack.<br>**All:**<br>Foundations in knowledge of JS, HTML and CSS, as well as databases in general. This stems from Software Tools in Year 1.|A server that is always online in order to respond to any requests made to it<br>Potentially a subscription to MongoDB – depending on how large traffic will be. However they do offer a free version|Client may not be willing to constantly spend money to keep the service up<br> Only one person in group with experience – might cause a lot more work for the others Non-SQL database might be confusing as it is unfamiliar and unlike other databases we are comfortable with|
|**Languages:** Python, HTML, CSS <br>**Framework:** Django <br>**Database:** MySQL <br> **Targeted Platform:** Browser |This combination of technologies covers the full spectrum of web development needs, from server-side processing to database management and front-end presentation. Comprehensive and well-rounded choice for building dynamic, scalable, and maintainable web applications. Python and Django handle server-side logic and database interactions, while MySQL provides a robust relational database system. HTML and CSS ensure that the content is well-structured and visually appealing for users.|Versatile, powerful stack to create ThinkingSpace application ideas with ability to implement AI.|Everyone in the team has done MySQL, HTML, CSS in the first year of the course. Everyone is familiar with Python from different previous experiences. Noone has ever worked with Django but everyone is keen to broaden their knowledge and make the best out of this powerful framework.|Due to the dynamic nature of Python, larger projects are more difficult to maintain. The template system in Django makes it possible to separate logic from presentation, which makes it easy to maintain and update templates. MySQL is a well-established relational database management system with strong support and tools for performance tuning, monitoring, and backups. HTML and CSS are static and don’t have the complexity of backend code or databases so are easy to maintain.|Django’s ORM protects against SQL injection, but using raw SQL queries or poorly written forms can introduce vulnerabilities. Over time, the codebase can accumulate technical debt if best practices are not followed. This makes the system more difficult to maintain and could introduce bugs or inefficiencies. If third-party libraries are poorly maintained or contain security vulnerabilities, they can pose a risk to the overall application.|
