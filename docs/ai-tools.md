# AI Tools

How each member has used AI throughout the project

## Emma: 
### Tools Used:
- ChatGPT

### AI Generated Code:
- I used AI to generate small outlines of code if I struggled to find other resources, it was for very specific tasks

### Debugging with AI:
- Debugging code so that I could unpick errors, particualarly when I couldn't find any help online (StackOverflow)

### Other usage:
- Understanding and learning concepts, such as how session storage works, and how data is passed between the front and back end

## Ethan: 
### Tools Used:
- ChatGPT
- Dependabot

### AI Generated Code:
- I often found that getting to grips with the basics of new libraries/languages was easier when ChatGPT generated the basic setup/framework. For example, it provided me with an outline of how to structure and run CI tests using the supertest library, which I could then tweak to test the specific parts of the webpage. 

### Debugging with AI:
- ChatGPT helped me to debug a number of errors, that couldn't be solved by reading manuals or searching online.
- I would normally provide it the error message/code, and try my best to solve the issue given its advice.

### Version management:
- This only happened once, but we got a notification that one of our libraries was out-of-date, and had security vulnerabilities. Dependabot handled this, and created us a pull request with this issue fixed.

### Other usage:
- Generating AWS setup instructions for the handover document. To do this manually would have been time consuming and I would have arrived at the same result. I provided the steps for what I did (as you could setup AWS in many different ways), but the specific steps and instructions were generated by ChatGPT.

## Mykola:
- ChatGPT

### AI Generated Code:
- Sometimes I used it to create some small code skeletons which I then worked with.

### Debugging with AI:
- Due to no previous experience with JS I found it particularly difficult to debug. If I couldn't find hists online I would ask ChatGPT for help, which was successful not more than half of the times.

### Other usage:
- Often when implementing something new to the code I could ask ChatGPT to educate me on it so I can be more informed on how to do my task.

- ## Anni: 
### Tools Used:
- ChatGPT

### AI Generated Code:
- Approaching unfamiliar languages, if syntax was too specific for external sources, I occasionally used AI for a basic outline which I could then develop to more advanced code that does the certain task.

### Debugging with AI:
- Quickly identifying errors in large amounts of code. It was effective in checking inconsistent naming of variables, mis-ordering and pinpointing what is wrong to which I then resolve independently or following suggested steps. 

### Other usage:
- Explaining unfamiliar concepts such as passing images and data between HTML pages so that I could understand the logic to work with.
