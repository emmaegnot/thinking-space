Ethical issues - thinking space
Protect rights, dignity, health, safety and privacy of anyone we interact with

if working with real users/testers, we need to conform with the uni ethics regulation

we already have approval that covers low-risk “users interaction with software”. this covers anonymous surveys, recording screengrabs of people using our system

anything which could create a risk to the physical/mental health of users needs to be discussed with unit directors
	⁃	this could be mental health of a child, such as exacerbating negative behaviour
	⁃	this software is used when a child is most vulnerable, so we need to be careful
	⁃	are we going to interview kids or just get information from the client?
	⁃	are we going to test the product on kids or just have the client testing?
	⁃	if we want children to be our test users we need a full faculty ethics review


ethics pre-approval form:
outline the project goals and the main functionality of the software

describe the intended use of the software. In particular, what data users will enter, in particular if personal data is involved

will you recruit anyone to evaluate your software, other than your clients?
y/n
if yes

	•	describe that user group, how are you going to recruit them?
	•	are there any potential participants who will be excluded? if so, what are the exclusion criteria
	•	how many participants?
	•	how will informed consent be obtained from all participant or their parents/guardians
	•	how long to decide whether they give consent
	•	are there potential risks (physical, psychological, legal, social) to the participants
