## Introduction

This document serves as a technical guide for new developers to begin working on this project, given existing code infrastructure. It will explain the purpose of a large proportion of the repository, with further code-specific details being found in comments throughout the codebase.

### What is The Thinking Space?

The Thinking Space aims to tackle behavioural problems in children by providing them with a way to communicate and express themselves through a selection of visual elements. In the standard teaching environment, the student-to-teacher ratio does not allow for behaviour management on a personal level, so we hope that this project will provide children with a safe environment to regulate their mood and feelings.

In order to see the client's original brief, in this folder is a pdf that shows this.

## Build and Execution

### Prerequisites

First, you will need Node.js and Docker installed on your machine:

- Install [```Node.js```](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- Install [```Docker```](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

The next step is to create a local copy of the repository:

- Run ```git clone https://github.com/spe-uob/2024-ThinkingSpace.git```

In order to install all dependencies, run ```npm install```

### Environment variables

The following variables are used for our project. Some require you to create a .env file in the root, and some are stored in GitHub secrets, so you do not need to worry about defining these.

| Variable Name   | Purpose                          | Where It's Stored           |
|-----------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| `MONGO_URI`     | Connection string for database  | GitHub Secrets, `.env` (local)|
| `AWS_ACCOUNT_ID`| The AWS account ID where the IAM role is located | GitHub Secrets   |
| `AWS_ROLE_NAME` | The name of the IAM role that GitHub Actions will assume | GitHub Secrets |
| `AWS_REGION` | The AWS region where resources will be deployed or managed | GitHub Secrets |
| `AWS_INSTANCE_ID` | The specific EC2 instance ID where the deployment is happening. Used to fetch the instanceâ€™s IP and execute commands via SSM. | GitHub Secrets |

### Accessing the website

If you just want to see the project, you can skip the setup, and access the website on the internet by navigating to [www.thethinkingspace.me](https://www.thethinkingspace.me/), and this should connect you to the website, running on an AWS EC2 instance. With every merge to the dev branch, our GitHub actions will use our Continuous Development setup to automatically deploy the changes. However, when working on a branch, it is recommended to test the site locally first, as it is best practice to only deploy a website that has been reviewed and confirmed to work.
TheOnce this is set up, you should be able to access the website.

To host and view the website locally, navigate to the root folder then in the terminal, run ```node src/server/server```. On your browser, enter the url http://localhost:3000/ and the website will appear.

### Accessing the database

The server connects to the database using MongoDB Atlas and is done by looking into the .env file for a connection string.

Your own connection string can be generated by:
1. creating a MongoDB Atlas account
2. being added to the ThinkingSpace project
3. adding your IP address to the table of known users
4. connecting to the cluster using drivers
5. Pasting this string in your .env file: MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://admin_user:password@your-cluster.mongodb.net/myDatabase?retryWrites=true&w=majority
6. Replacing the admin_user and password with your one

### Accessing the EC2 Node
The IP address of the instance is 13.53.72.180, and this is an elastic IP so should not change.
Port 3000 is open to any IP address, and this is where the server listens to requests and hosts the website.
Port 22 is also open, but to a limited range of IP addresses. This port allows a user to SSH into the instance and run commands such as docker and git. In order to add your IP address to the range you must:
1. Log into the AWS account
2. Navigate to the EC2 Page
3. Find the security groups tab on the left
4. Edit inbound rules for the group named launch-wizard-1 - this is the one associated with the instance.
5. Add a new SSH rule, and make its source your current IP address
Following this, you will also need your own SSH key. To generate one, you must
1. Log into the AWS account
2. Navigate to the EC2 page
3. In the left menu, click Key Pairs (under "Network & Security").
4. Click Create Key Pair.
5. Enter a Key Pair Name (e.g., new-key).
6. Choose a type and format
7. Click Create Key Pair and download the file (making sure it is stored securely).
8. Go to EC2 Dashboard then Click your Instance ID.
9. Go to Click Actions then Manage Sessions then Start Session. Once inside, run:
```
cd ~/.ssh
echo "YOUR_NEW_PUBLIC_KEY" >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```
Using this key, you should now be able to securely connect to the instance though SSH. You can use the command
```
ssh -i /path/to/new-key.pem ec2-user@13.53.72.180
```

## Project Structure
Code relating to the project itself can be found in the src folder at root level. Anything outside of this folder are files for Github, Docker, Node.js or generic project work like this README and some research. In src, the code can generally be organised into four sections: database, frontend, backend and CI.
### Database
Within the models folder, we have two pieces of Javascript code, Student.js and Teacher.js. These define the Student and Teacher data structures (referred to as schemas) that our database uses. It is similar to a class in OOP, where we define the attributes here, and create them later in the server code.
### Backend
Within the server folder, our main backend file, server.js can be found. This is the file we run to get the website up and running. It is decently long, but essentially it describes how our server should react to a multitude of different requests.
### Frontend
The code relating to the frontend can be found in a few different folders within src. First there is the public folder. In the server, we allow users of the website to be able to access anything in this folder. It includes images, font files and our stylesheet file, style.css, which are all needed to enhance the look of the webpages.
There is also the views folder, which contains all of our different .ejs (essentially HTML) pages. These can be fully-defined pages, or partial ones that are then loaded into the other .ejs files.
### Continuous Integration
Within the tests folder, you can find all of the CI tests that Github will automatically run for us each time we push to a branch. They essentially make requests to the server and compare the actual response with the expected response. There is a different file for each page we test.
