## Introduction

This document serves as a technical guide for new developers to begin working on this project, given existing code infrastructure. It will explain the purpose of a large proportion of the repository, with further code-specific details being found in comments throughout the codebase.

### What is The Thinking Space?

The Thinking Space aims to tackle behavioural problems in children by providing them with a way to communicate and express themselves through a selection of visual elements. In the standard teaching environment, the student-to-teacher ratio does not allow for behaviour management on a personal level, so we hope that this project will provide children with a safe environment to regulate their mood and feelings.
