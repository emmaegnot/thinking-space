## Overview

This website aims to tackle behavioural problems in children by providing them with a way to communicate and express themselves through a selection of visual elements. In the standard teaching environment, the student-to-teacher ratio does not allow for behaviour management on a personal level, so we hope that this project will provide children with a safe environment to regulate their mood and feelings.

## Technology Stack

This has yet to be decided - hopefully we have more of an idea following our lecture on 4/10
